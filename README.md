# Inverse Finance Exploit Replay

Welcome to the Inverse Finance Oracle Manipulation Exploit Replay.

To clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kuly14/Inverse_Finance_Exploit_Replay
```
Then install dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```
To run this exploit you will need to fork the mainnet so the contract can use real data from before the exploit.
So rename .env.example to .env and inside the file add your API KEY. I recommend alchemy. 

Now you are ready to exploit Inverse Finance

To deploy the contract: 
```bash
yarn hardhat deploy
```
To test the contract: 
```bash
yarn hardhat test
```
This will go through the entire flow of the exploit.
